        <!-- 
            Working with audio elements we start 
            noticing a pattern right?
            to implement audio we can do so with a
            browsers built in audio player
            the syntax for audio is as follows
            <audio controls(for the player)
            autoplay(for autoplay)
            muted(to start as muted)
            loop(to loop the song constantly)
            src(source to file, path or link)>
            all the attributes, contorl, autoplay, muted and loop
            are all boolean, meaning they are either
            true or false, and simply having them set
            makes them true.

            If there are several sources to try out
            you can line them up indented to the audio line
            and the browser will try each solution in order
            you can add a last line stating its not possible to play
            if needed.
            end all of it with </audio

        <audio controls autoplay muted loop src="/music/Introspective Taal - Aakash Gandhi.mp3">
            <source src="/music/Introspective Taal - Aakash Gandhi.mp3">
