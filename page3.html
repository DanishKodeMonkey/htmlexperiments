        <!--
            SO! A image can be placed on a web page easily
            Its usually good practise to assemble images
            in a folder for easier reference

            The syntax for image placement is as follows
            image source=path or link to image, 
            optionals are  height=value, width=value, 
            (good practise for screen readers) alt="description"
            and title for hovertext

            Furthermore a image can be wrapped into a 
            link by preceding it with the 
            <a href="path/link"> jargon
            and putting the close tag </a> AFTER the image code
        -->
        <a href="page4.html" target="_self" title="Click me for page 4">
            
        <img src="/images/thecodemonkey.png" height="300" alt="Picture of a monkey coding!" title="Danish kode Monkey">
        </a>
